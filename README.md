# oneFootball
oneFootball is a single player football game, inspired from an old arcade game named PingPong.
oneFootball is a JS coded HTML canvas game.
Rules of the game are pretty simple. You’re the only player versus the computer or finely called the ‘AI’.

Unlikely from football soccer game, here except of 11 team players, you’re the only one in the team - both goalkeeper and the striker!
Goal is just to put the ball out of his paddle reach and out of the screen.  While the AI tries to do the same against you ;)
Try to score 3 against the AI, and you may win the game just for now, as AI gets stronger and better the more you play against it. Hope you enjoy,
Happy Playing !
