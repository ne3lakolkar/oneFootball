# oneFootball

oneFootball is a canvas game created using HTML and JS.   
Rules of the game are pretty simple. You’re the only player versus the computer called the ‘AI’.   

Unlikely from football soccer game, here except of 11 team players, you’re the only one in the team - both goalkeeper and the striker!

Happy Playing !

## How to play?
Goal is just to put the ball out of his paddle reach and out of the screen.  
While the AI tries to do the same against you ;)

Try to score 3 against the AI, and you may win the game just for now, as AI gets stronger and better the more you play against it. 

Hope you enjoy!
